-- Instructions:
--   Write your SQL query beneath each comment block.
--   Do NOT modify the comment markers (-- Q1, -- Q2, etc.) — the autograder uses them.
--   Test each query locally: psql -h localhost -U postgres -d testdb -f queries.sql

ORDER BY total_salary DESC;


-- Q3: Highest-Paid Employee per Department

-- Q9: Schema Design — Employee Certifications
-- Design and implement a certifications tracking system.
--
-- Tasks:
-- 1. CREATE TABLE certifications (certification_id SERIAL PK, name VARCHAR NOT NULL, issuing_org VARCHAR, level VARCHAR)
-- 2. CREATE TABLE employee_certifications (id SERIAL PK, employee_id FK->employees, certification_id FK->certifications, certification_date DATE NOT NULL)
-- 3. INSERT at least 3 certifications and 5 employee_certification records
-- 4. Write a query listing employees with their certifications (JOIN across 3 tables)
--    Expected columns: first_name, last_name, certification_name, issuing_org, certification_date

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employee_certifications;
